# WhyWomenDeserveLess-references
The references in Myron Gaines' book *Why Women Deserve Less* are a mess. This repo aims to better present and preserve them.

The two PDFs will added to this repo and the other links archived on archive.is and web.archive.org. 

(Link rot)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot/] is a real problem on the internet! Try to prevent this being a problem by frequently archiving useful web links!
